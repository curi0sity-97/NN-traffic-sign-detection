# Traffic Signs Detection
Notebook for training and evaluating several types of neural networks on the task of traffic sign detection. The Keras-Autotuner is used to determine the optimal hyper-parameters for each net.

## Implemented types of neural nets
- Multi Layer Perceptrons
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Autoencoders for better efficiency
